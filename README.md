# [LIVE WEBSITE](http://jonpadilla.com/about.html)
          
# Description:
The website was developed using the [Materialize](http://materializecss.com/) Framework which includes Jquery. I used the Materialize framework due to its expanded features and customization over [BootStrap](http://getbootstrap.com/2.3.2/). Both frameworks utilize a grid which makes creating layouts for websites much easier.<br><br>
          The banner and nameplate were designed by me in Adobe Photoshop. I tried to keep the sizes of all included images on the page below 400kb to keep page load times low. Originally I was going to use screenshots of each individual project but it would have taken a large amount of space and time to do. Instead I used resizable icons to give my pages a professional look.<br><br>
          The navbar is pinned to the top after a certain distance down the page. I altered the Javascript files included in the Materialize framework to do this. The navbar is also moved to a side navigation if the screen size meets a certain threshold.<br><br>
          The Night Mode switch included in both the main navigation and side-navigation uses Javascript to overwrite classes on the website. By simply changing the class of the body element of the web page and adding the appropriate CSS the color scheme of the page is changed. In order to keep the color consistent across the different pages I used <a target=”_blank” href=”http://www.w3schools.com/html/html5_webstorage.asp”>local storage</a> over cookies. <br><br>
          Lastly the Javascript files were compressed in order to improve load times of the pages.
